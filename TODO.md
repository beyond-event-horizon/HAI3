## TODO

- Fix header component. It's based on HTML elements, which violates ui kit ans styling guidelines.
- Fix default theme colors. Menu border color is different than header border, which is not the case for all the other themes,
- Get rid of Javascript code in favor of TypeScript.
- User information is not present in the header until the profile screen is loaded.
- Rename Menu to MainMenu. Update file names, variables names, etc. everywhere.
- Main menu collapsed state misalignment.
